# 🔐 Secure Password Generator (Python)

A customizable, secure password generator built in Python. This script allows users to define the length and contents of the password—including uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and symbols—with **guarantees that at least one of each selected type is present**.

## 🚀 Features

- User-defined password length.
- Option to include:
  - ✅ Uppercase and lowercase letters (at least one uppercase is required if selected)
  - ✅ Digits (at least one digit required if selected)
  - ✅ Symbols (at least one symbol required if selected)
- Strong validation to ensure complexity.
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs.
- Password randomness is ensured using Python’s `random` module.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

🧠 Logic Highlights
Ensures one character from each selected category is included.

Shuffles the characters to prevent predictable patterns.

Handles edge cases, like too-short passwords, or no category selected.
